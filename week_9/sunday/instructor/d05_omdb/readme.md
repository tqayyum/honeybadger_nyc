# Backbone + OMDBapi = OMGLOLWUT

## User Stories

* I would like to be able to search for a movie based on a search term
* I would like to be able to see the movies details in my browser window

## Tools

* jQuery
* [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) - Please explore the docs to discover how to use OMDB API to get the response data we desire.

## Step 1 - Explore the OMDB API

Per our user stories, we need our API to provide with two kinds of responses.

First, we need to be able to get a return of movies based on a movie title search for.  This should return at most 10 titles that match our second term.

From this initial return, we need to be able to get a specific movie's full details based on its imdbID.

Please explore the OMDB API documentation to discover how this can be achieved.

## Step 2 - Setting up files

  * `index.html`
  * `app.js`
