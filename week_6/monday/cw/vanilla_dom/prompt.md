### Vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation

* Access the page title
* Make the page title red (by adding a class to the page title)

* Access the list
* Add a fourth item to the list
* Make the list items blue (add classes to each list item, not to the ul element)

* Move the image to after the list


* Make the description green
* Add a red footer paragraph to the page with the id "page-footer"
* Instead of having that starter HTML in the page, write JavaScript to **construct** this page
