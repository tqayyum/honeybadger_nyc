## Trip To MorDOMr

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice using 'Vanilla' JavaScript to manipulate the DOM

We are going to take a trip from the Shire, through Rivendell, across Middle
Earth, and into the heart of Mordor itself, Mount Doom. Pack up, because we're
going on an adventure.

### Step 1-13

Observe the 13 chapters that have been included in the starter code (app.js). Each
chapter has a button with a click handler in the html file, and an associated javascript function in app.js. Your job is to fill in the right code into the JS functions.

Remember you can check your DOM tree in the Elements tab in Chrome Console.

**Workflow**

Tackle this problem one function from start to finish at a time.

* Write a trivial console.log inside the function to check that the event
  listener works when you click the right button
* Write the correct DOM manipulatory code inside the function and check that it
  works

Each function depends on the previous ones, so make sure your function works
before moving on to the next one!

Every time you refresh the page, you will have to click the buttons one by one
in order from the beginning to operate your application. (If you really don't want 
the popups after you've completed a step, you can check to disable each popup and
speed up the process of debugging).
